## **🏗️ Project Overview**

This Kaggle competition was presented through a collaboration between Break Through Tech and the Algorithmic Justice League for students to build a machine learning model that classifies skin conditions across various skin tones in order to “advance equity by centering those historically excluded in AI” and avoid diagnostic errors, late treatments, and health disparities for underserved groups. The Algorithmic Justice League is “an organization that combines art and research to illuminate the social implications and harms of artificial intelligence”. Their mission to increase public awareness about the effects of AI, provide advocates with resources to run campaigns, strengthen the voice and chose of impacted groups, and excite researchers, policymakers, and industry practitioners to work against the harms of AI.

## **📊 Data Exploration**

The dataset used is a subset of the FitzPatrick17k dataset, a labeled set of ~17,000 images of various serious and cosmetically dermatological conditions across a variety of of skin tones that are scored through the FitzPatrick skin tone scale (FST). This set contains around 4,500 images from the dataset and represents 21 skin conditions (out of over 100). The subset is used in order to have a more manageable and satisfying classification problem while maintaining appropriate amount of representation issues.* Data exploration and preprocessing approaches

* Challenges and assumptions when working with the dataset(s)

**Describe (as applicable):**

* Model(s) used (e.g., CNN with transfer learning, regression models)
* Feature selection and Hyperparameter tuning strategies
* Training setup (e.g., % of data for training/validation, evaluation metric, baseline performance)

---

## **📈 Results & Key Findings**

**Describe (as applicable):**

* Performance metrics (e.g., Kaggle Leaderboard score, F1-score)
* How your model performed overall
* How your model performed across different skin tones (AJL)
* Insights from evaluating model fairness (AJL)

**Potential visualizations to include:**

* Confusion matrix, precision-recall curve, feature importance plot, prediction distribution, outputs from fairness or explainability tools

## **🖼️ Impact Narrative**

**AJL challenge:**

As Dr. Randi mentioned in her challenge overview, “Through poetry, art, and storytelling, you can reach others who might not know enough to understand what’s happening with the machine learning model or data visualizations, but might still be heavily impacted by this kind of work.”
As you answer the questions below, consider using not only text, but also illustrations, annotated visualizations, poetry, or other creative techniques to make your work accessible to a wider audience.
Check out [this guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kYKaVNR\_l7Abx2kebs3AdDi6TlPviC3q/view) from the Algorithmic Justice League for inspiration!

1. What steps did you take to address [model fairness](https://haas.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/What-is-fairness_-EGAL2.pdf)? (e.g., leveraging data augmentation techniques to account for training dataset imbalances; using a validation set to assess model performance across different skin tones)
2. What broader impact could your work have?
